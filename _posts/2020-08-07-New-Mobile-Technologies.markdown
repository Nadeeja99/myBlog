Are you interested about new trends? Well then this is for you!!!!!
Today I’m talking about Latest Mobile Technologies.
Let’s go then!
1. Artificial intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence is the study and development of intelligent machines and computer programs that are able to simulate human intelligence. 
So, we are seeing more and more progress in artificial intelligence, especially in the mobile phone sector. 
Mobile industry trends have focused on artificial intelligence since 2017 when Apple allowed developers to integrate voice assistant Siri into their applications.
These are some of the most famous smartphone features with AI
VOICE ASSISTANTS
Current smartphones have basic functionality for virtual assistants who are improving rapidly. Voice Assistants like Samsung’s Bixby, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa all use data to understand their users’ voice commands and to perform a variety of tasks. With Bixby Vision, users can learn details about objects and locations, find out how to purchase items they see in the real world, and translate languages, among many other tasks.
2. AI IN THE CAMERA
AI is already in the camera of most high-end smartphones. Artificial intelligence algorithms help determine whether you capture a landscape or a person and adjust the type of filter for best results. Artificial intelligence can also help you find the right lens for the lighting conditions.
3. FACIAL RECOGNITION
AI facial recognition feature is a security feature that allows users to unlock their phone using their face. Facial recognition is possible through the use of artificial intelligence algorithms and machine learning to identify the faces of owners trying to unlock their phone.
4. IDENTIFICATION OF IMAGES
Artificial intelligence allows the system to recognize images, offer labels and group them into albums. It also helps to keep track of images because they can be searched using keywords. This feature is available in the cloud via Google Photos.
2. Augmented Reality

Augmented reality, commonly known as “AR,” is computer-generated content overlaid on a real-world environment. A growing number of mobile applications will integrate the functionality of Augmented Reality (AR) in 2020 and this trend will not disappear.
These types of applications involve the real world in the application.
Pokemon Go

Pokemon Go is a perfect example of an augmented reality app.Grass, trees, sky and power lines exist for the image above. If he took out his camera, he would see everything on the screen. But an augmented reality app adds elements to your device that aren’t actually there, like the fictional Pokemon character above
Snapchat
This is one of the best examples of AR is the face filter options on Snapchat. Recently, Instagram implemented this feature as well.
Health care professionals may soon rely on smartphone-enabled AR. A company called Tissue Analytics is honing an app that helps doctors and nurses use their phones to quickly identify specific types of wounds for faster diagnosis and more efficient care
3. Blockchain Apps

Blockchain is the technology the underpins digital currency (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and the like). So Blockchain is certainly a turning point in several areas, including the development of mobile applications
In the App Store and Google Play, you can find lots of applications coupled with blockchain. They are mostly e-wallets, currency converters, digital asset tracker apps and networking solutions.
Blockchain, however, is not just about cryptocurrency. It integrates with many industries to create more new projects. For example, Verisart uses the Blockchain to verify the authenticity of works of art.
This technology offers a special security approach that can help you to protect your mobile platform and retain your customers.
The benefits of blockchain-powered apps are:
Improved data protection and reduced risks of data loss
Quicker transactions
Simplicity
Transparency
In 2020 and the following year, specialists expect an increase in blockchain-based mobile solutions, as devices can serve as blockchain nodes.
4. IoT Apps

To support the development and development of the Internet of Things (IoT), the mobile phone industry has developed and standardized a class of dedicated mobile technologies. It’s a way of connecting physical things (like sensors) to the Internet, essentially using the same things behind your smartphone.
The increasing demand for smart things results in the growing number of IoT applications. A smartphone serves as the bridge between intelligent systems and people, while an application is the main tool for managing connected devices.
IoT apps allow you to:
Monitor readings of devices and sensors
Analyze data, build charts and reports
Manage devices (open/close, turn on/off, trigger alarms, and more)
Wearables: Wearables are an integral part of IoT solutions. By using connections like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, it is possible to connect wearables like wristwatches, eyeglasses and even bands to your smartphones. This way, any form of data can be exchanged between the two devices.
Healthcare: Medical devices are connected to sensors which obtain health data from the patient which is transferred to the mobile app. This data can be transferred remotely to the doctor or family members in case of emergency. This way, the need to visit the hospital for minor issues is substantially reduced.
These Mobile IoT networks support devices requiring broad coverage, a long battery life and low cost, yet secure, connectivity across both rural and urban locations.
The Internet of Things is becoming widespread in many areas, from medical care to education to production and transportation. The development of mobile device applications is currently the fastest growing sector. The main representatives are applications for smartwatches, Fitbits, smart columns and home assistants.
5. Cloud Apps

The cloud-based data, applications, and services that have been designed specifically to be used on the mobile devices are comprehensively referred to as the Mobile Cloud.
A cloud app is an application that operates through the cloud and has a unique combination of characteristics from both, pure desktop apps and pure web apps.
How the Cloud Apps work?
In a remote data centre, usually managed by third parties, data is stored and computation cycles are performed. The availability, integration, and security aspects are offered by a backend that also supports various access methods.
Cloud apps are known for their responsiveness and the fact that they must not be permanently stored on the device. These applications can work well online but need to be updated online.
Advantages of Mobile Cloud Apps
Easier to stick to the budget as they are cheaper
Secure functioning across multiple devices
Much more computing power
Better storage and loading capacity
Increasing user retention
Streamlining operations
Dropbox: This application is a file-hosting service which offers cloud storage. It lets the users access their files in the Dropbox from their Android devices, which can be synced to other computers or mobile devices.
Amazon Cloud Player: This is used to store and play MP3 files. Here the Cloud Drive acts as a hard drive set in the cloud. Users can play their MP3 files via the web or they can conveniently stream them on their Android devices using Amazon ‘Cloud’ MP3 application.
An increasing number of mobile apps will become cloud-based.
Conclusion
We are in the 3rd decade in the 21st Century and today Technologies are now in the centre of attention for all industries. So mobile technology is one of the fastest-growing industry in the world. These are the some of trending technologies in the mobile sector.
